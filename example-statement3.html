      </div>

      <div id="statement-conformance">
        <h3>Conformance status</h3>
        <p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) have three conformance levels (A, AA and AAA). These guidelines provide criteria to make web content more accessible for everyone, including for people with disabilities. https://www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/after/home.html is Partially conformant with the WCAG 2.1 AA standard. Partially conformant means that Some parts of the content do not fully conform to the accessibility standard (you can indicate these parts in later sections of this form).</p>

      <div id="statement-additions" class="conditional" data-if="accstmt_additions">
        <h4>Additions to the requirements</h4>
        <p>Although our goal is level AA conformance, we have also applied some level AAA success criteria. For example, images of text are only used for decorative purposes. When an authenticated session expires, the user can continue the activity without loss of data after re-authenticating. We added sign language in all our videos.</p>
